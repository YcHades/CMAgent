> A modular Agent framework built on the **Msg In / Msg Out** paradigm.

This project is a **modular and extensible Agent framework** designed around a unified **Message In / Message Out** abstraction.
Agents, tools, and execution nodes communicate exclusively through standardized messages, enabling clean decoupling and flexible composition.

The framework provides a **unified tool management system** that supports both:

* **MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools**
* **Local Python tools**

By abstracting tool invocation and execution flow, the framework enables **model-agnostic, tool-agnostic, and composable Agent architectures**, making it suitable for building complex multi-agent systems.

**Key Features:**

* 🧩 Msg In / Msg Out–driven modular architecture
* 🔌 Unified tool abstraction for MCP and local Python tools
* 🧠 Decoupled Agents, tools, and execution logic
* 🔄 Composable and extensible execution pipelines
* 🛠️ Designed for rapid prototyping and production-ready Agent systems
